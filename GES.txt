This system implements a novel Physics-Based Classification approach for robotic action generation. It uses computer vision (CAD line extraction) and time-series modeling (Keras/Joblib) to learn the kinematic profiles (Velocity, Acceleration, and Angular Velocity) of objects from video input, and then uses those profiles to predict the necessary commands for robotic execution.

🚀 Modes of Operation
The system has two primary modes, selected from the main menu:

LEARN (Unlearned Task): Processes a new video, extracts kinematic data, and uses that data to retrain/update the overall knowledge base (Keras models and Joblib scalers). This is how the robot acquires new skills.

DO (Known Task): Processes a video of an action, identifies the matching kinematic profile using the stored models, and generates a prediction CSV containing robot commands.

Installation and Setup
1. Prerequisites
You must have Python installed and be working within the dedicated Virtual Environment created for this project to ensure all dependencies are met.

2. File Structure
Ensure the following directory structure exists relative to the main executable (VLA_Prediction_System.exe or main.py):

VLA_Prediction_System/
├── VLA_Prediction_System.exe (or main.py)
├── data/
│   ├── bulkcsvout/ (Stores temporary raw line geometry CSVs)
│   ├── training_sequences/ (Stores the master combined_kinematic_sequences.csv)
├── models/ (Stores trained Keras models and Joblib scalers)
├── action_commands/ (Stores the final robot_action.csv output)
└── [Required Scripts - bundled by PyInstaller]

That's a fantastic, unique name! GlimmarianEmbeddedSystems V1 clearly denotes a specialized, foundational, and integrated version of your project.

I will update the key introductory and title elements in the README to reflect this new brand name.

3. Baseline Assets
The models/ directory must contain the initial set of Keras models (e.g., model_class_1.h5, model_class_2.h5, etc.) and the corresponding Joblib scalers (e.g., scaler_class_1.joblib) for the existing "known" skills.

💻 How to Use the System
Start the application by running the executable or the main script:

Bash

# If running the compiled executable:
./VLA_Prediction_System.exe

# If running the Python script during development (within the virtual environment):
python main.py

Troubleshooting and MaintenanceIssuePotential CauseSolutionImportErrorPyInstaller failed to bundle a dependency (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).Rebuild the executable using the .spec file and ensure the necessary dependency (hiddenimports) is added to the a.hiddenimports list.Model Load FailureKeras or Joblib files are missing or corrupted.Ensure the models/ directory contains all necessary .h5 and .joblib files, matching the expected Vector_Class IDs.Error: File not foundThe user entered an incorrect video path.The user must enter the full, absolute path to the video file.Poor Prediction QualityInsufficient training data.Run the LEARN mode multiple times with variations of the task to build a robust combined_kinematic_sequences.csv.
